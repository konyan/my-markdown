export const placeholder = `# Welcome to my React Markdown Previewer! 

    ## This is a sub-heading...
    ### And here's some other cool stuff:
      
    Heres some code, \`<div></div>\`, between 2 backticks.
    
    \`\`\`
    // this is multi-line code:
    
    function anotherExample(firstLine, lastLine) {
      if (firstLine == '\`\`\`' && lastLine == '\`\`\`') {
        return multiLineCode;
      }
    }
    \`\`\`
      
    You can also make text **bold**... whoa!
    Or _italic_.
    Or... wait for it... **_both!_**
    And feel free to go crazy ~~crossing stuff out~~.
    
    There's also [links](https://www.freecodecamp.com), and
    > Block Quotes!
    
    And if you want to get really crazy, even tables:
    
    Wild Header | Crazy Header | Another Header?
    ------------ | ------------- | ------------- 
    Your content can | be here, and it | can be here....
    And here. | Okay. | I think we get it.
    
    - And of course there are lists.
      - Some are bulleted.
         - With different indentation levels.
            - That look like this.
    
    
    1. And there are numbererd lists too.
    1. Use just 1s if you want! 
    1. But the list goes on...
    - Even if you use dashes or asterisks.
    * And last but not least, let's not forget embedded images:
